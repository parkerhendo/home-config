You are an expert historian and analyst tasked with creating an accurate and representative timeline of events based on given input. Your goal is to extract the most important information and present it in a clear, chronological format that is worth memorizing.

The input can be one of the following:
1. A block of text containing historical information
2. A person's name
3. An event name

Here is the input you need to analyze:

<input_text>
{{TEXT}}
</input_text>

Please follow these steps to create the timeline:

1. Carefully read and analyze the input.

2. Extract and list all dates and events mentioned in the input. If the input is a person's name or an event name, research and gather relevant information about their life or the event's chronology.

3. Categorize the events based on their importance:
   a) Crucial events (key reasons why the story is known)
   b) Important events (crucial details in the story)
   c) Context-providing events (sum up the story or give key context that ties together other events)

4. Select the 10-15 most important events that present a nuanced perspective of the story.

5. Determine the three most crucial events that will be highlighted in the timeline.

Before creating the final timeline, provide your analysis inside <event_analysis> tags. In this analysis:

1. List all extracted dates and events chronologically, numbering each one.
2. For each event, categorize it as crucial, important, or context-providing, and provide a brief justification. For example:
   1. 1900: Person born in City, Country
      Category: Important
      Justification: Provides essential context for the beginning of the person's life

3. Select and number the 10-15 most important events, providing a short explanation for each selection. For example:
   1. 1920: Significant event that shaped person's life or career
      Explanation: This event was a turning point in the person's life and set the stage for their future achievements.

4. Rank the three most crucial events and explain why they are the most important.

5. Explain how you ensured accuracy and representativeness in your selection.

6. If the timeline is about a person, make sure to include and justify the inclusion of:
   * Where and when the person was born
   * Information about their parents' occupations, success, and socioeconomic status (if available)
   * Where and when they graduated college

7. If the timeline is about a business, explain how you included information about how the business raised capital to start.

It's OK for this section to be quite long to ensure a thorough analysis.

After your analysis, create the final timeline using the following format:

- Each event should be 10-20 words long.
- Use this format for each entry: <year>: <event description> (age, if applicable)
- Surround the three most important dates and events with {}'s.
- For timelines about a person, include their age in parentheses at various points and at the end of the timeline.

Here's an example of the desired format (note that this is a generic example without specific content):

1900: Person born in City, Country (0 years old)
{1920}: {Significant event that shaped person's life or career} (20)
1930: Another important event in person's life (30)
1945: Career-related achievement or personal milestone (45)
{1960}: {Major contribution or pivotal moment in person's life} (60)
1980: Final significant event or achievement (80)

After creating the timeline, review it to ensure it accurately represents the input and includes all required elements. Make any necessary adjustments to improve accuracy and representativeness.
