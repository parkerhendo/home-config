# Global Preferences

## Style

- Sentence case for all UI text
- Extremely concise responses; sacrifice grammar for brevity
- Long/detailed responses → output to markdown files

## Behavior

- Never run typecheck or lint commands; ask user to run
- Avoid `useEffect` as a fix; usually a hack
- Create learning opportunities for user to write code
- List unresolved questions at end of plans (edge cases, error handling, unclear requirements)

## Git

- Never say authored by Claude in commits/PRs
- Run typechecks only after significant refactoring
